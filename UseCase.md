I am working on creating a developer competition that will be used to to find good data engineers that can build a end to end data pipelines using Snowflake as the database. 
The competition will be a series of challenges that will be used to test the skills of the participants.
There will be a total of 10 challenges that will be used to test the skills of the participants.
The challenges will be designed to test the skills of the participants in the following areas:
- Data Engineering
- Data Architecture
- Data Modeling
- Data Warehousing
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis
- Data Science

the scenario will be a company that is a online retail store that sells products to customers.
The company has a website that allows customers to browse and purchase products.
The company has a backend system that handles the orders and inventory.
The company has a frontend system that allows customers to browse and purchase products.
The company has a mobile app that allows customers to browse and purchase products.
The company has a data warehouse ,data lake, data mart and a data warehouse that stores the data for the company.

The business outcomes will be to creat the following metrics:
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Total Customers
- Total Products
- Total Employees
- Total Suppliers
- Total Customers
- Total Orders
- Total Products
- Total Revenue per Product per Customer segmentation
- Customer lifetime value
- Customer acquisition cost
- Customer retention rate
- Customer satisfaction score
- Customer churn rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Customer retention rate
- Customer satisfaction score
- Customer churn rate

Create a prompt that i can use to build this in Cursor.
The following script needs to be created:
1) 00_Setup.sql - which will use to setup the database with tables and sample data. 
2) 01_DataEngineeringPipeline.ipynb - A notebook for each step of the data processing. 
3) 02_Dashboard.py - A streamlit in Snowflake app that can be use to visualise the output from the the processing and to showcasse the metrics described previous.
